# Hi there👋 I'm Aldyth 
*Glad to see you here!*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

💻 I'm currently remote working as IBM Maximo Consultant at PT Talian Infodinamika

📝 My current job task was:
      
- manage and transfer client data to maximo
     	
- build automation script to fit Maximo UI based on client requests using python or jython
      
- testing Maximo application after customizing based on client requests
     	
- create supporting documents

🧶 Crochet was one of my hobbies to fill up my spare time, I also make a pre-order to my products and sell it to e-commerce

__*... Disclaimer ...*__

__*Maximo installation is done directly in the client environment, so after the project is finished I don't have resources or access rights to maximo client resources*__

Well, this was all my task that I've ever done in Maximo since I've been working as IBM Maximo Consultant at PT Talian Infodinamika
