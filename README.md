__*Disclaimer*__

__*Maximo installation is done directly in the client environment, so after the project is finished I don't have resources or access rights to maximo client resources. So, my work portfolio is the documents that I have worked on and the contents of these documents are based on the results of the work I have done at Maximo*__


...

Well, this was all my task that I've ever done in Maximo since I've been working as IBM Maximo Consultant at PT Talian Infodinamika
